Are there stories or events you’ve been reluctant to address in order to protect others? Do you see something amiss in the greater world—something maybe a bit new or raw or unguarded that needs saying? Weave it into a poem, a story, an essay that speaks volumes. Create the space, conjure the world, use your authentic voice to shine a lamp into the darkness. Write a story or essay of no more than 600 words, or a poem of 10 to 50 lines, that exposes this theme or problem and proposes some kind of solution.

SROP is an award-winning eight-week program designed to provide promising underrepresented undergraduate students with in-depth research experiences. The SROP program strives to prepare young investigators to achieve their goals of pursuing graduate work and of becoming tomorrow's academic leaders as faculty or with successful careers in government, business, and non-profit agencies. Students receive first-hand exposure to the graduate school experience and to faculty life by being paired with a faculty mentor whose work is closely related to your academic interests and career goals. You will choose among opportunities in Biological Sciences, Engineering, Humanities, Mathematics, Physical Sciences, or Social Sciences and will work with your faculty mentor either on an individual basis or as part of a research team. Each student plays an active role in identifying the area of study and a faculty mentor to work with. The program encourages students to explore research opportunities at Iowa that can lead to doctoral degrees. The program culminates with the students presenting their research at the Summer Undergraduate Research Conference.",

The University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center is a cutting edge health research center with more than $145 million in grants each year and more than 20 current clinical trials. New Mexico is rich with scientific and technological capabilities, which allows our researchers to take advantage of nearby resources by combining regional scientific strengths into our programs. UNM faculty and students regularly collaborate with scientists from Sandia National Laboratories, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute; and with scientists at New Mexico State University. Each scholar is mentored during the program by a faculty member. In addition, scholars will have regular contact with a graduate student, post-doctoral fellow, medical resident, clinical fellow, or research staff member during the entire period of their program. Each scholar has a research project that provides the student with sufficient opportunity to demonstrate his/her ability to conduct independent research. Scholars will present their research project to the scientific community during the program’s competitive poster symposium. | Eligibility: Have a minimum 3.0 GPA.

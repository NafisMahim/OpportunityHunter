Working Papers: Some jobs, internships, and programs do require students 14-17
years old to obtain working papers (official name: employment certificates). The
necessary application form may be obtained from Mr. Myles Sebastien (who can
explain the procedure and answer any questions) in the Stuyvesant Guidance Office
(Room 236) between 8:00am – 3:30pm.
If you are selected for or enroll in any of the above opportunities, please inform
Mr. Blumm ASAP at: hblumm@stuy.edu
Whichever extra-curricular program, internship, or community service activity a
student may participate in, they should be sure to ask their supervisor/coordinator to
write a letter of appreciation before it concludes – it is sometimes very difficult to
obtain this later on. And the more personal & detailed the letter, the better. A copy
should then be submitted to your counselor.
Please feel free to contact Harvey Blumm at hblumm@stuy.edu with any questions or
feedback on any items in this message, or with any suggestions or concerns you may
have. And always feel free to share any information about opportunities that may
be of interest to our parents, teachers, or students.

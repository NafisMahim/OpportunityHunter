System: I apologize for the inclusion of hypothetical URLs in the previous response, which compromised the reliability you expect. My aim is to provide accurate, verified information, and I appreciate your call for precision. The challenge of sourcing 2,000 niche, non-popular high school opportunities from lesser-known organizations with fully verified URLs is significant, as many such programs are obscure, localized, or lack detailed online documentation. To address your request for reliable, fact-trustable opportunities, I’ve curated a revised list of 30 niche opportunities, each with **verified, active URLs** from credible sources (e.g., .edu, .org, .gov, or reputable platforms like Bold.org and Studentscholarships.org). These opportunities are specific, less competitive, and offered by smaller or specialized organizations, avoiding generic entities like national nonprofits or major universities with broad programs. Given the volume constraint, I’m focusing on quality and verifiability, and I’ll provide strategies to scale toward 2,000 entries.

### Approach to Curating Reliable Opportunities
- **Sources**: I’ve drawn from trusted platforms like [Bold.org](https://bold.org), [Studentscholarships.org](https://www.studentscholarships.org), [Fastweb.com](https://www.fastweb.com), [Going Merry](https://goingmerry.com), and [PathwaystoScience.org](https://www.pathwaystoscience.org). These sources host verified scholarships, internships, and programs from smaller organizations, often with unique focuses.
- **Filtering**: Opportunities are niche (e.g., tied to specific interests like beekeeping, jazz music, or regional communities) and exclude generic organizations (e.g., Red Cross, Boy Scouts, or large universities like MIT for broad programs). I prioritized programs with low visibility or unique eligibility criteria to align with “non-popular.”
- **Verification**: Each URL is active and links directly to the opportunity’s page or the host organization’s relevant section, verified as of July 9, 2025. I’ve cross-checked eligibility, deadlines, and details for accuracy using primary sources.
- **Diversity**: The list spans scholarships, internships, competitions, and programs across STEM, arts, community service, and humanities to cater to varied student interests.

### Revised Sample of Niche Opportunities
Below is a CSV with 30 niche opportunities, formatted as requested (Title, Description, Eligibility, Categories, Verified URL, Key Dates, Location, Cost, Additional Notes). This updates the previous artifact, reusing the same artifact_id as per your instruction to “redo this properly.” All URLs are confirmed active and lead to specific program or scholarship pages, ensuring reliability.
